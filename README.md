## Description

This is a very simple budget and expense viewer. You can add and remove funds from your budget and underneath you will see a graphical representation of your budget incomes and outgoings

 However, as the name suggests, this is also a PWA application meaning that if you go offline you can still remain connected to the page! All transactions added during periods of spotty or downed connection will be put into your browser's IndexedDB.

Then as soon as you get back online those transactions will sync with the database and you will be able to continue as though the internet wasn't even an issue.
